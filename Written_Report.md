# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

- The purpose of this project was to find out with the given data what month was best to launch a kickstarter campaign in regards to a holding a play. Additionally, we wanted to find out the percentage of successful campaigns vs failed in regards to the pledge goal of the respective campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- I decided (was assigned) to narrow down the given data in a pivote chart in order to easily visualize the data that Louise would like to see. I broke this down to Theater and years to find out the outcomes in regard to the months the campaigns were held in.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- Additionally, I found out the number of successful, failed, and canceled play campaigns given specific goal ranges. With that information I was able to find out the percentage of successful vs failed campaigns, luckily their were no canceled ones.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-Some challenges I faced was to figure out how to get the Axis correct on the Pivot Chart, I ended up putting date created converstion there and it worked but i'm unsure if it is the correct thing to do. With the outcome vs goals data I had a bit more trouble getting the formulas correct. Took me awhile to figure out which correct collums to pull from for the respective collum on this sheet and after that I had to correct my ranges within the formula to dispaly the correct data on the line graph. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 

    - The summer months are very popular/a good time to launch a campaign, May, June, July and August. These months have the most successful campaigns completed.
    
    - The number of failed campaigns does not change that drastically throughout the year, however the percentage of failed campaigns relative to the successful ones decreases in the summer months. Meaning the summer months are the best to launch a campaign for a play. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    - The main thing that I can conclude is that plays that have a goal $5000 or less have the highest % of being successful, although generally there is a higher chance of success than failures overall. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    
    - It would be pretty hard to identify the specific genre of plays that are successful vs failed in campaigns without looking at the whole data set and combing through each blurb and play name. So if this was for a real kickstart campain that might be difficult to relay that information in a easy to read way. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    - In the exercise prior to the challenge we did country specific analysis on plays, through the use of pivot tables as well as a bar graph that would be an exellent adition to the data to present.
